## Prerequisites

Below is a list of the required packages and libraries that need to be installed in order to run the project.

### The Basics

- PHP 7.4 ([PHP Docs](https://www.php.net/docs.php))

## Installation

### Cloning the Repository

After setting up your machine, clone the project onto it.

```bash
git clone <repository_url> subscript
```

### Installing the Dependencies

Next, go to the project's root directory and install the dependencies using Composer and NPM.

```bash
cd subscript
composer install
npm install
```

### Configuring the Environment Variables

Now that the dependencies are installed, create a fresh copy of the `.env` file which will hold all your variables.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Configure the newly created `.env` file, and make sure to go through all the keys.

Next, create a new `APP_KEY` by running the following artisan command.

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

### Creating the Database

Create a new database and configure your database connection in the `.env` file.
The `--seed` option runs the seeder which generates basic data such as currencies.  

```bash
php artisan migrate --seed
```

### Running the Tests

You can run the unit tests and feature tests with the command below.

```bash
php artisan test
```

## Deployment

In order to deploy the project on a server, start with a regular installation as mentioned above.

### Compiling the Assets

Next, compile and minify assets by running the following command.

```bash
npm run prod
```

### A Note on Permissions

You might need to grant the appropriate permissions for the `storage` and the `bootstrap` directories.

```bash
chmod -R o+w storage bootstrap
```
